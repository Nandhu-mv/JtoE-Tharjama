There was a small village in the middle of a quiet forest, surrounded by mountains and rivers.
In the spring the cherry blossoms bloomed together and the air was filled with sweet smells.
I woke up in the morning with the bird’s voice and slept quietly under the starry sky at night.
There was a strange story in the village from ancient times, when the night of the full moon,
A white fox appears on the banks of the river; the fox does not hurt anyone, only quietly.

The disease was healed, and the crops were rich and fruitful, and the villagers were foxes.

It was a good rom.
