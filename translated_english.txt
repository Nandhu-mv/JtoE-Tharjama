As a man, the cherry blossoms bloomed at once, and the air was filled with sweet smells.The village awoke in the morning with a voice of calling.The night fell asleep under the starry sky.The village had a strange story from old.On the night of the full moon, a white fox appeared on the banks of the river.The fox did not harm anyone.On the spring of one year, a boy said he had seen the white fox.He began to happen.The disease healed and the crops reaped.
